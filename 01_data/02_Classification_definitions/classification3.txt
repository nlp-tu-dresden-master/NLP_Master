Classification is one of the most common applications for data mining. It corre- sponds to a task that occurs frequently in everyday life. For example, a hospital may want to classify medical patients into those who are at high, medium or low risk of acquiring a certain illness, an opinion polling company may wish to classify people interviewed into those who are likely to vote for each of a num- ber of political parties or are undecided, or we may wish to classify a student project as distinction, merit, pass or fail.
