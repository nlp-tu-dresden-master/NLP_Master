Clustering algorithms partition data objects (patterns, entities, instances, observances, units) into a certain number of clusters (groups, subsets, or categories). However, there is no universally agreed upon and precise definition of the term cluster. Clearly, a cluster in these definitions is described in terms of internal homogeneity and external separation (Gordon, 1999; Hansen and Jaumard, 1997; Jain and R. Dubes, 1988), i.e., data objects in the same cluster should be similar to each other, while data objects in different clusters should be dissimilar from one another. Both the similarity and the dissimilarity should be elucidated in a clear and meaningful way.
