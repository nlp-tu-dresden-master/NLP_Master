The goal of data clustering, also known as cluster analysis, is to discover the natural groupings of a set of patterns, points, or objects. Webster (Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2008) defines cluster analysis as ‘‘a statistical classification technique for discovering whether the individuals of a population fall into different groups by making quantitative comparisons of multiple characteristics.” The objective is to develop an automatic algorithm that will discover the natural groupings in the unlabeled data. An operational definition of clustering can be stated as follows: Given a representation of n objects, find K groups based on a measure of similarity such that the similarities between objects in the same group are high while the similarities between objects in different groups are low.
