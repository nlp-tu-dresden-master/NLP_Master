Clustering is the process of partitioning or grouping a given set of patterns into disjoint clusters. This is done such that patterns in the same cluster are alike and patterns belonging to two different clusters are different. Clustering has been a widely studied problem in a variety of application domains including neural networks, AI, and statistics.
