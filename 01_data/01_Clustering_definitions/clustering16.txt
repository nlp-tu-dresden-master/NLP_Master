Clustering is an important and one of the primary used techniques for the automatic knowledge extraction from large amounts of data. Its task is exploring the distribution of objects in a data set. Generally, clustering is defined as a technique for partitioning a data set into groups (clusters) so that the data items in the same cluster are as similar as possible, and the data items assigned to different clusters are as dissimilar as possible.
