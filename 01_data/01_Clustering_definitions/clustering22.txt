Clustering algorithms group a set of documents into subsets or clusters. The algorithmsâ€™ goal is to create clusters that are coherent internally, but clearly different from each other. In other words, documents within a cluster should be as similar as possible; and documents in one cluster should be as dissimilar as possible from documents in other clusters. Clustering is the most common form of unsupervised learning. No supervision means that there is no human expert who has assigned documents to classes. In clustering, it is the distribution and makeup of the data that will determine cluster membership. It is visually clear that there are three distinct clusters of points.
