Clustering techniques apply when there is no class to be predicted but rather when the instances are to be decided into natural groups. These clusters presumably reflect some mechanism at work in the domain from which instances are drawn, a mechanism that causes some instances to bear a stronger resemblance to each other than they do to the remaining instances. Clustering naturally required different techniques to the classification and association learning methods that we have considered so far. As we saw in Section 3.6, there are different ways in which the result of clustering can be expressed. The groups that are identified may be exclusive: any instance belongs in only one group. Or they may be overlapping: an instance may fall into several groups. Ot they may be probabilistic: an instance belongs to each group with a certain probability. Or they may be hierarchical: a rough division of instances into groups at the top level and each group refined further - perhaps all the way down to individual instances. Really, the choice among these possibilities should be dictated by the nature of the mechanisms that are thought to underlie the particular clustering phenomenon. However, because these mechanisms are rarely known - the very existence of clusters is, after all, something that we’re trying to discover - and for pragmatic reasons too, the choice is usually dictated by the clustering tools that are available.
