Clustering analysis finds clusters of data objects that are similar in some sense to one another. The members of a cluster are more like each other than they are like members of other clusters. The goal of clustering analysis is to find high-quality clusters such that the inter-cluster similarity is low and the intra-cluster similarity is high.
