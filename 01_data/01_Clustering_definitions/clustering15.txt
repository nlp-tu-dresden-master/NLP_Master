Cluster analysis is the formal study of algorithms and methods for grouping, or classifying, objects. A cluster is comprised of a number of similar objects collected or grouped together. Everitt (1974) documents some of the following definitions of a cluster: 1. A cluster is a set of entities which are alike, and entities from different clusters are not alike. 2. A cluster is an aggregation of points in the test space such that the distance between any two points in the cluster is less than the distance between any point in the cluster and any point not in it. 3. Clusters may be described as connected regions of a multi-dimensional space containing a relatively high density of points, separated from other such regions by a region containing a relatively low density of points.
