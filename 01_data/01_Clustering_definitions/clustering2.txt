Clustering techniques consider data tuples as objects. They partition the objects into groups, or clusters, so that objects within a cluster are “similar” to one another and “dissimilar” to objects in other clusters. Similarity is commonly defined in terms of how “close” the objects are in space, based on a distance function. The “quality” of a cluster may be represented by its diameter, the maximum distance between any two objects in the cluster. Centroid distance is an alternative measure of cluster quality and is defined as the average distance of each cluster object from the cluster centroid (denoting the “average object,” or average point in space for the cluster). Figure 3.3 showed a 2-D plot of customer data with respect to customer locations in a city. Three data clusters are visible.
