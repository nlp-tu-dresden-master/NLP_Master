Clustering can be defined as the process of grouping a collection of N patterns into distinct segments or clusters based on a suitable notion of closeness or similarity among these patterns. Good clusters show high similarity within a group and low similarity between patterns belonging to two different groups. For applications such as customer or product segmentation, clustering is the primary goal. But more often it is a crucial intermediate step needed for further data analysis, a view underscored by the placement of the cluster utility in the "exploration" stage in Enterprise Miner, a leading data mining software from SAS institute.
