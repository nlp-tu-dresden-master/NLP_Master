Cluster Analysis technique as a field grew very quickly with the goal of grouping data objects, based on information found in data and describing the relationships inside the data. The purpose is to separate the objects into groups, with the objects related (similar) together and unrelated with another group of objects. It is being applied in variety of science disciplines and has been studied in myriad of expert research communities such as machine learning, statistic, optimization and computational geometry.
