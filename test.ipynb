For example, an insurance company might group customers according to income, age, types of policy purchased or prior claims experience. In a fault diagnosis application, electrical faults might be grouped according to the values of certain key variables.\\n Clustering is the process of making a group of abstract objects into classes of similar objects. Cluster analysis groups data objects based only on information found in the data that describes the objects and their relationships. The goal is that the objects within a group be similar (or related) to one another and different from (or unrelated to) the objects in other groups. The greater the similarity (or homogeneity) within a group and the greater the difference between groups, the better or more distinct the clustering. Clustering is the grouping of a particular set of objects based on their characteristics, aggregating them according to their similarities. Regarding to data mining, this metodology partitions the data implementing a specific join algorithm, most suitable for the desired information analysis. Clustering can be defined as the process of grouping a collection of N patterns into distinct segments or clusters based on a suitable notion of closeness or similarity among these patterns. Good clusters show high similarity within a group and low similarity between patterns belonging to two different groups. For applications such as customer or product segmentation, clustering is the primary goal. But more often it is a crucial intermediate step needed for further data analysis, a view underscored by the placement of the cluster utility in the \"exploration\" stage in Enterprise Miner, a leading data mining software from SAS institute. Clustering can be considered the most important unsupervised learning problem; so, as every other problem of this kind, it deals with finding a structure in a collection of unlabeled data.\\nA loose definition of clustering could be “the process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way”.\\nA cluster is therefore a collection of objects which are “similar” between them and are “dissimilar” to the objects belonging to other clusters. Clustering techniques consider data tuples as objects. They partition the objects into groups, or clusters, so that objects within a cluster are “similar” to one another and “dis- similar” to objects in other clusters. Similarity is commonly defined in terms of how “close” the objects are in space, based on a distance function. The “quality” of a cluster may be represented by its diameter, the maximum distance between any two objects in the cluster. Centroid distance is an alternative measure of cluster quality and is defined as the average distance of each cluster object from the cluster centroid (denoting the “average object,” or average point in space for the cluster). Figure 3.3 showed a 2-D plot of customer data with respect to customer locations in a city. Three data clusters are visible.\\nIn data reduction, the cluster representations of the data are used to replace the actual data. The effectiveness of this technique depends on the data’s nature. It is much more effective for data that can be organized into distinct clusters than for smeared data. Data clustering is a method in which we make cluster of objects that are somehow similar in characteristics. The criterion for checking the similarity is implementation dependent. Cluster Analysis technique as a field grew very quickly with the goal of grouping data objects, based on information found in data and describing the relationships inside the data. The purpose is to separate the objects into groups, with the objects related (similar) together and unrelated with another group of objects. It is being applied in variety of science disciplines and has been studied in myriad of expert research communities such as machine learning, statistic, optimization and computational geometry. Clustering analysis finds clusters of data objects that are similar in some sense to one another. The members of a cluster are more like each other than they are like members of other clusters. The goal of clustering analysis is to find high-quality clusters such that the inter-cluster similarity is low and the intra-cluster similarity is high.'}\n"
